# Overview

**Cryptophecy**, which stands for **Cryptocurrency Prophecy**, is a simple bet game developed using Chainlink reference data contract at the backend side and React for the Web UI interaction.

Gamblers can come to play whenever and as many times as they want by guessing whether the **Bitcoin** exchange rate after 1 hour will raise, drop, or be unchanged and then betting an arbitrary amount of **Ethereum** (at least 0.01 ETH) for that prediction. If the actual exchange after 1 hour since the moment their requests were submitted matched their guess, the gamblers would be rewarded an amount of **2.9 times** their stake. Otherwise, they receive nothing.
